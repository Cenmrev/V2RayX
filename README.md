## Download V2RayX

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/releases). (compiled by [travis-ci.org](https://travis-ci.org/Cenmrev/V2RayX)).

By [Homebrew-Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/).

```sh
brew install v2rayx --cask
```

## How to build

V2RayX.app is built by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with curl.

`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/master/compilefromsource.sh)"`

or step by step:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX.git`

open V2RayX.xcodeproj and use Xcode to build V2RayX.

## How does V2RayX work

V2RayX provides a GUI to generate the config file for V2Ray. It includes V2Ray's binary executable in the app bundle. V2RayX starts and stops V2Ray with `launchd` of macOS.

V2RayX also allows users to change system proxy settings and switch proxy servers on the macOS menu bar.

As default, V2RayX will open a socks5 proxy at port `1081` as the main inbound, as well as a http proxy at port `8001` as an inboundDetour.

V2RayX provide three modes:
* Global Mode: V2RayX asks macOS to route all internet traffic to v2ray core if the network traffic obeys operating system's network rules.
* PAC Mode: macOS will determine the routing based on a pac file and some traffic may be routed to v2ray core.
* Manual Mode: V2RayX will not modify any macOS network settings, but only start or stop v2ray core.

Options in menu list `Routing Rule` determine how v2ray core deals with incoming traffic. Core routing rules apply to all three modes above.

### auto-run on login

Open macOS System Preferences -> Users & Group -> Login Items, add V2RayX.app to
the list.

### manually update v2ray-core
replace `V2RayX.app/Contents/Resources/v2ray` with the newest v2ray 
version from [v2ray-core 
repo](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases). However, compatibility is not guaranteed.

### Uninstall

V2RayX will create the following files and folders:

* `/Library/Application Support/V2RayX`
* `~/Library/Application Support/V2RayX`
* `~/Library/Preferences/cenmrev.V2RayX.plist`

So, to totally uninstall V2RayX, just delete V2RayX.app and the files above. :)

## Acknowledge

V2RayX uses [GCDWebServer](https://github.com/swisspol/GCDWebServer) to provide a local pac server. V2RayX also uses many ideas and codes from [ShadowsocksX](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-iOS/tree/master), especially, the codes of [v2rays_sysconfig](https://github.com/Cenmrev/V2RayX/blob/master/v2rayx_sysconf/main.m) are simply copied from [shadowsocks_sysconf](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-iOS/blob/master/shadowsocks_sysconf/main.m) with some modifications.

This tool is mainly for personal usage. For professional users and technique

The developer does not major in CS nor Software Engineer and currently is busy with grad school courses. So V2rayX will not be updated frequently. Users can replace V2RayX.app/Contents/Resources/v2ray with the newest v2ray-core downloaded from [https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases](https://github.com/v2ray/v2ray-core/releases).

The developer currently does not have enough time to add more features to V2RayX, nor to merge PRs. However, forking and releasing your own version are always welcome.
